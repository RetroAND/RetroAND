Greetings, my alias is retroAND.

I'm interested in old computers as well digital electronics per se.
I'm currently learning analog electronics at the cost of a few burns.
I'm looking to collaborate on hardware projects, as well software (from assembly to C# and Unity).
Althought my native language is Catalan, I speak and write Spanish, english and a bit of Japanese. I am currently expanding this nice set with Deutsch, but I'm still too green at it.

Regards!
